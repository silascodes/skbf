Cheat program to brute force mine positions in Satoshi-Karoshi bitcoin game.

The Satoshi-Karoshi website is no longer alive, but you can still find it on archive.org. Program has no interface, you must enter parameters in the source code (yes it was a pretty quick 'n dirty program).

Unfortunately, this only worked on the pretend money version of the game, the real money version was too computationaly intensive to brute force. Otherwise I'd be rich!
